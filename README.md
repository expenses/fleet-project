* proper ui
* allow for ship construction from minerals
* health bars?
* resize ships
* improved movement system
* evasion/fleeing is kinda wierd and hard to get right - consider removing.
* use tlas for choose enemy target - need to store position and side.
* Smooth rotations to make them less jittery
